"""When to compress, what to compress, and what to keep verbatim.

The policy is the only piece that mutates ``ConversationHistory`` beyond
``append`` — specifically, it now also owns the sliding-window trim itself
(``ConversationHistory.append`` no longer does, see ``app/sessions/models.py``
for why). It runs after each turn (``EstimationService.estimate_in_session``
calls ``apply_compression`` right after ``history.append``), with this loop,
in order:

1. While the sliding window is over the cap (``max_turns * 2`` messages),
   peel the oldest user/assistant pair off the front.
2. Send the user side of the pair to the ``AnchorDetector``. If it's an
   anchor, move BOTH messages of the pair into ``history.anchors`` so the
   commitment survives verbatim. Otherwise, queue both for the summarizer.
3. After the loop, if any non-anchor pairs were peeled off, hand them to the
   ``CumulativeSummarizer`` together with the previous summary, and replace
   ``history.summary`` with the new running text.

The policy is intentionally idempotent: a second call with no change to
``messages`` is a no-op.
